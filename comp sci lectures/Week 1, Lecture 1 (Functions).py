# our first function: write a function that takes a number and doubles it

# in math: f(x) = 2x

# in Python:
def double(x):
    return 2 * x

# 'def'is a keyword
# "double" is the name of the function
# "x" is the name of the argument to the function
# the colon is required
# the rest of the function is called its *body*
#   it has to be indented
#   a sequence of instructions
#   the return statement computes a value and returns it as the result of the function

# example: given someone's age (integer), return their year of birth

def birthyear (x):
    return 2022-x

# example: write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the maximum of their squares

def maxsquare (num1,num2): 
    return max(pow(num1,2), pow(num2,2))

def magic8ball (question):

def maxcube (x,y):

def birthyear (x):
    return 2022-x

def magic8ball (question):
    return 'Definitely!'

def squared (x):
    return pow(x,2)

def height (x):
    return 12*x
